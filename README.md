# Privacy Policy
## Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online and offline information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

## The Information We Collect

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted by `[organization]` apps. For some apps, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

* Name
* E-mail address
* Google account E-mail address (if different from main E-mail address)

We also use Firebase Analytics to collect usage statistics and for error reporting. Both of these can be opted-out in the app's Settings. None of this information can be used for personal identification.

## How We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

We use usage statistics to improve user experience by better understanding how users are using our apps.

We use error reports to improve the reliability of our apps.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

## Our Commitment to Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

## How to Access or Correct Your Information

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by emailing `[email]`. To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.

## How to Contact Us

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please send us an e-mail at `[email]`.
